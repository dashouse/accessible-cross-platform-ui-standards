        <ol class="standards">
            <li>Be inclusive by default</li>
            <li>Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</li>
            <li>Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</li>
            <li>Strive for simplicity</li>
            <li>Respect user preferences</li>
            <li>Value behavioural consistency as much as visual cohesion</li>
            <li>Be honest about technology</li>
            <li>Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</li>

            <h2 id="standard-1">Be inclusive by default</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Never rely on settings or modes to meet basic accessibility standards</li>
                <li>Settings can and should be used to further enhance an already accessible experience</li>
                <li>Don't associate all accessibility features with assistive techology</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">

                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Settings require awareness, ease of discovery and an understanding of how they could help. Don't assume people who could benefit from Accessibility settings are aware they exist</li>
                    <li>Web or Webviews within apps cannot reliably use OS settings to meet accessibility standards. If you rely on accessibility settings in app, shared cross-platform design is not possible</li>
                    <li>Adding accessible UI only when a screen reader is detected buckets unrelated disabilities together. Avoid making an “accessibilty view" and make your default experince accessible.</li>
    
                </ul>

            </div>

            <h2 id="standard-2">Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Always go beyond the minimum accessibility guidelines</li>
                <li>Know which criteria are relevant for each platform</li>
                <li>Follow an established standard for how to apply WCAG to Native apps</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>All websites, web apps and web-views should exceed WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/">WCAG2ITC</a> provides a "notes in the margin" approch to how WCAG 2.2 can bee applied to non-web software and documents</li>
                    <li>The European Standard for Accessibility excludes 6 WCAG success criteria (and modified 13) for appications. Read about this on <a href="https://appt.org/en/guidelines/en-301-549">Appt.org - EN 301 549</a></li>
                    <li>Aligning to a universal standard means Design and QA will have less ambiguity about what they should audit native apps and web against</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="standard-3">Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Take the best and ignore the rest</li>
                <li>Recognise when operating system design decisions don’t meet high enough standards and develop your own</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Native operating systems have some amazing accessibility features that are a great enhancement to any experience</li>
                    <li>You’ll benefit from yearly updates and improvements using iOS and Android patterns</li>
                    <li>Google and Apple don’t always get it right when it comes to accessible UI. Take the responsibility to not pass on these mistakes to your users</li>

            <h2 id="standard-4">Strive for simplicity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Content and interface design should be as simple to comprehend and use as possible. Regularly question every element on a screen and actively remove as much as you add</li>
                <li>Avoid novelty compromising usability</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Everything on the screen is something a user needs to think about</li>
                    <li>Unproven or elements of little value are often left in interfaces indefinitely</li>
                    <li>Know the right time to be playful or expressive. Opportunities for Delight and Desirability are built on a strong foundation of being Functional and Useful</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="standard-5">Respect user preferences</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Native apps and websites need to adapt to personal settings. That could be increasing font size, using custom styles or turning off animations</li>
                <li>When we have themes, such as Light and Dark mode, they should meet the same accessibility standards. The only exception is when the user has asked us not to</li>
            </ul>


            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Light and Dark themes are not explicit accessibility features, they should both meet WCAG 2.2</li>
                    <li>Having a single mode that is accessible will exclude people that cannot use that mode</li>
                    <li>Over a third of people increase their font size or use an accessibility feature</li>
                    <li>We don’t get to choose how people view our websites and services</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="standard-6">Value behavioural consistency as much as visual cohesion</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Elements that look the same should behave the same</li>
                <li>Make sure people have a genuinely consistent experience, not just a visually similar one</li>
                <li>Think about keyboard interaction, how elements are described or how errors are handled</li>
                <li>When working with third party suppliers and white label products we need to ensure that they meet these standards too</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>We need to actively promote design is “how things work” and not just what it looks like</li>
                    <li>Organisations under estimate the accessibility issues caused by “skinning” websites</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent keyboard interaction is significantly more impactful to a user than the wrong colour or wrong border radius</li>
                    <li>People that move between platforms or domains should have a predicatble experience</li>

            <h2 id="standard-7">Be honest about technology</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Strive to create native experiences to whatever platform the customer is interacting with</li>
                <li>When you mix technology, be honest about it</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Webviews, even in “Software” need to be treated as websites. They cannot access many accessibility features of mobile operating systems</li>
                    <li>The design of web and native elements will need to be different in a number of places</li>
                    <li>People should be able to recognise when they are in a webview. Their interactions and audible cues will be different and they may need to adjust how they browse</li>

            <h2 id="standard-8">Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>The majority of websites and apps are not accessible</li>
                <li>Don't base your standards on other companies or competetors. Let them to base their standards on you</li>
                <li>Be ok with parts of the design being different when they have to be</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>WebAim surveyed the top 1 million home pages and 56,791,260 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 56.8 errors per page</li>
                    <li>If we base "good" on organisatons that do the bare minimum for accessibility, we add to the problem</li>
                    <li>The standards organisations say they will meet rarely align with the reality</li>
                    <li>You can always, always, always do more</li>
