        <p>A set of standards for designing accessible UI across the web, iOS and Android</p>

    <main>

        <h2>The Standards</h2>

        <ol class="standards">
            <li>Be inclusive by default</li>
            <li>Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</li>
            <li>Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</li>
            <li>Strive for simplicity</li>
            <li>Respect user preferences</li>
            <li>Be honest about technology</li>
            <li>Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Be inclusive by default</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Never rely on settings or modes to meet basic accessibility standards</li>
                <li>Settings can and should be used to further enhance an already accessible experience</li>
                <li>Don't associate all accessibility features with assistive techology</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">

                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Settings require awareness, ease of discovery and an understanding of how they could help. Don't assume people who could benefit from Accessibility settings are aware they exist</li>
                    <li>Web or Webviews within apps cannot use OS settings to meet accessibility standards. If you rely on accessibility settings in app, shared cross-platform design will not be possible</li>
                    <li>Adding extra UI when a screen reader is detected buckets unrelated disabilities together, promotes the idea of a “normal” and “other” view</li>
    
                </ul>

            <h2>Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Always go beyond the minimum accessibility guidelines</li>
                <li>Know which criteria are relevant for each platform</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>All websites, web apps and web-views should exceed WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
                    <li>Choose to follow something like the European Standard for Accessibility for Native apps which excludes 6 WCAG success criteria (and modified 13)</li>
                    <li>Alighing to a standard means Design and QA will have less ambiguity about what they should audit native apps and web against</li>
                    <li>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is coming</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Take the best and ignore the rest</li>
                <li>Recognise when operating system design decisions don't meet high enough standards and make your own</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Native operating systems have some amazing accessibility features that are a great enhancement to any experience</li>
                    <li>You'll benefit from yearly updates and improvements using iOS and Android patterns</li>
                    <li>Google and Apple don’t always get it right when it comes to accessible UI decisions. In fact, they have proven history of getting it wrong</li>
                    <li>Many public service apps have gone against Apple and Android guidelines in some areas for Accessibility reasons</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Strive for simplicity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Content and interface design should be as simple to comprehend and use as possible. Regularly question every element on a screen and actively remove as much as you add</li>
                <li>Avoid novelty compromising usability</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Everything on the screen is something a user needs to think about</li>
                    <li>Unproven or elements of little value are often left in interfaces indefinitely</li>
                    <li>Know the right time to be playful or expressive. Opportunities for Delight and Desirability are built on a strong foundation of being Functional and Useful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Respect user preferences</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Native apps and websites adapt to personal settings, that could be increasing font size, using their own styles or turning off animations</li>
                <li>Don't design a single "accessible" mode. When we have themes, such as Light and Dark mode, they meet the same accessibility standards. The only exception is when the user has asked us not to.</li>
            </ul>


            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Light and Dark themes are not explicit accessibility features, they should both meet WCAG 2.2</li>
                    <li>Having a single mode that is accessible will exclude people that cannot use that mode</li>
                    <li>Over a third of people increase their font size or use an accessibility feature</li>
                    <li>We don’t get to choose how people view our websites and services</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Value behavioural consistency as much as visual cohesion</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Elements that look the same should behave the same</li>
                <li>Make sure people have a genuinely consistent experience, not just a visually similar one</li>
                <li>Think about keyboard interaction, how elements are described or how errors are handled</li>
                <li>When working with third party suppliers and white label products we need to ensure that they meet these standards too</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>We need to actively promote design is “how things work” and not just what it looks like</li>
                    <li>Organisations always under estimate the accessibility issues caused by “skinning” websites</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent keyboard interaction is significantly more impactful to a user than the wrong colour or wrong border radius</li>
                    <li>People that move between platforms or domains should have a predicatble experience</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Be honest about technology</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Strive to create native experiences to whatever platform the customer is interacting with</li>
                <li>When you mix technology, be honest about it</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>Webviews, even in “Software” need to be treated as websites as they cannot access many accessibility features of mobile operating systems</li>
                    <li>The design of web and native will likely have to be different in a number of places. Web cannot always follow native standards because the UI maybe inacessible if used on web</li>
                    <li>People should be able to recognise when they are in a webview. Their interactions and audible cues will be different and they may need to adjust how they browse</li>

            <h2>Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>The majority of websites and apps are not accessible</li>
                <li>Don't base your standards on other companies or competetors. Let them to base their standards on you</li>
                <li>Be ok with parts of the design being different when they have to be</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="rationale-box">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>

                <ul class="rationale-details">
                    <li>WebAim surveyed the top 1 million home pages and 56,791,260 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 56.8 errors per page</li>
                    <li>If we base what good is on other people’s choices we only add to the problem</li>
                    <li>Many perceived “inspirational”, “modern”, “exciting” brands simply do not consider accessibility enough (or at all)</li>
                    <li>Many leading design agencies and ux consultancies or development houses do the absolute bare minimum for accessibility</li>
                    <li>You can always do more</li>
