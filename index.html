        <h2>The Standards</h2>

        <ol class="standards">
            <li>Be inclusive by default</li>
            <li>Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</li>
            <li>Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</li>
            <li>Strive for simplicity</li>
            <li>Respect user preferences</li>
            <li>Be honest about technology</li>
            <li>Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Be inclusive by default</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Never rely on settings or modes to meet basic accessibility standards</li>
                <li>Settings can and should be used to further enhance an already accessible experience</li>
                <li>Don't associate all accessibility features with assistive techology</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>Discoverability, awareness and understanding of settings and how they could help</li>
                <li>Web / Webviews cannot use settings to meet accessibility standards. Cross-platform design will never be aligned</li>
                <li>Adding extra UI when a screen reader is detected buckets all disabilities together, promotes the idea of a “normal” and “other” view</li>

            </ul>

        <section>

            <h2>Know what you need to meet, and aim to go further</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Always go beyond the minimum accessibility guidelines</li>
                <li>Know which criteria are relevant for each platform</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>All websites, web apps and web-views should exceed WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
                <li>Choose to follow the European Standard for Accessibility for Native apps which excludes 6 WCAG success criteria (and modified 13)</li>
                <li>Design and QA will have less ambiguity about what they should audit native apps and web against</li>
                <li>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is coming</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Respect platform conventions, but know when to go against them</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Take the best and ignore the rest</li>
                <li>Recognise when operating system design decisions don't meet high enough standards and make your own</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>Native operating systems have some amazing accessibility features that are a great enhancement to any experience</li>
                <li>You'll benefit from yearly updates and improvements using iOS and Android patterns</li>
                <li>Google and Apple don’t always get it right when it comes to accessible UI decisions. In fact, they have proven history of getting it wrong</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strive for simplicity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Content and interface design should be as simple to comprehend and use as possible. Regularly question every element on a screen and actively remove as much as you add</li>
                <li>Avoid novelty compromising usability</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>Everything on the screen is something a user needs to think about</li>
                <li>Unproven or elements of little value are often left in interfaces</li>
                <li>Know the right time to be playful or expressive. Opportunities for Delight and Desirability are built on a strong foundation of being Functional and Useful</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Respect user preferences</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Native apps and websites adapt to personal settings, that could be increasing font size, using their own styles or turning off animations</li>
                <li>Don't design a single "accessible" mode. When we have themes, such as Light and Dark mode, they meet the same accessibility standards. The only exception is when the user has asked us not to.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>Light and Dark mode are not accessibility features</li>
                <li>Having a single mode that is accessible will exclude people that cannot use that mode</li>
                <li>Over a third of people increase their font size or use an accessibility feature</li>
                <li>We don’t get to choose how people view our websites and services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Value behavioural consistency as much as visual cohesion</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Elements that look the same should behave the same</li>
                <li>Make sure people have a genuinely consistent experience, not just a visually similar one</li>
                <li>Think about keyboard interaction, how elements are described or how errors are handled</li>
                <li>When working with third party suppliers and white label products we need to ensure that they meet these standards too</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>We need to actively promote design is “how things work” and not just what it looks like</li>
                <li>Organisations always under estimate the issues caused by “skinning” websites</li>
                <li>Inconsistent keyboard interaction is significantly more impactful to a user than the wrong colour or wrong border radius</li>
                <li>People that move between platforms or domains should have a similar experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Be honest about technology</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>Strive to create native experiences to whatever platform the customer is interacting with</li>
                <li>When you mix technology, be honest about it</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>Webviews, even in “Software” need to be treated as websites as they cannot access many accessibility features of mobile operating systems</li>
                <li>The design of web and native will likely have to be different unless native applications follow web standards. Web cannot follow native standards</li>
                <li>People should be able to recognise when they are in a webview as their interactions and audible cues will be different</li>
            </ul>

        <section>

            <h2>Set a new benchmark of inclusivity</h2>

            <ul class="standard-details">
                <li>The majority of websites and apps are not accessible</li>
                <li>Don't base your standards on other companies. Let them to base their standards on you</li>
                <li>Be ok with parts of the design being different</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Rationale:</h3>

            <ul class="rationale-details">
                <li>WebAim surveyed the top 1 million home pages and 56,791,260 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 56.8 errors per page</li>
                <li>If we base what good is on other people’s choices we add to the problem</li>
                <li>Many perceived “inspirational”, “modern”, “exciting” brands simply do not consider accessibility enough (or at all)</li>
                <li>Many leading design agencies and ux consultancies or development houses do the absolute bare minimum for accessibility</li>
            </ul>
